emails are parsed using grammar.
# = hashtag
: = attribute
+ = item title
@ = email delimiter

``emaildsl

#hashtags
+title-of-this-item {
    
body-of-the-item
inside braces because they are not used otherwise in english grammar, unlike parenthesis and periods.
}

+item2 {
    this is a second item, being subitted. because #hashtags is the most recent # declaration, this item is submitted under that hashtag
}
username@hostname.com

:difficulty :benefit 

text that doesn't start with a special character is just text..
all actions that are possible in sorted competiteve folksonomy are possible it emaildsl.
  - pairwise votes

  +title-of-this-item 10:1 +item2  (explicit ratio)
  +item1 > +item2   (clearly better, 2:1 ratio)
  +item1 < +item2   (clearly worse, 1:2 ratio)
  +item1 = +item2   (equal, 1:1 ratio)

python lark library. 
Because then I can paste the users query and the grammar at an llm and give helpful error messages

i was thinking, of, to make it more robust to messy email than strict grammar, to have some rules of thumb: only start parsing on lines that start with !, #, +, /, etc. like a step before the parser checks for that condition, then initiates parsing. so then "sent from my iphone" is fine. and it only ingests the email if theres a parseable command in the file...
