I was thinking about structuring the site. Append only log of text files. Every email/submission gets archived. And sqlite/similar is the materialized, queryable view.

Strictly arbitrary in memory data structures at first.

Expand to rocksdb/sqlite when needed

using SQLite FTS5 for searching documents.

Unlisted rule:
in index, have regex filter for hashtags matching uuid as first 10 characters. Or check for hyphen at exact place…. Or something simple like that.
