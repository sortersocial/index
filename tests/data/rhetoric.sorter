First we declare the topic, with #. Like in IRC rooms.

#persuasion-modes

Then we declare item titles, with /, and item bodies with {}

/ethos { credibility, authority }
/pathos { audience emotions }
/logos { sense of reason and logic }

So far so good. Here's where it gets interesting. Let's make 2 pairwise judgments between these 3 items. 

:difficult
/ethos 2:1 /logos {
we are inside of a vote's justification right now
ethos is 2 parts difficult, logos is 1 part difficult.
this is because it takes a lifetime to build credibility, but seconds to wordsmith a passable argument.
}

/pathos = /logos {
because pandering to emotion isn't harder or easier than avoiding contradictions.
}
